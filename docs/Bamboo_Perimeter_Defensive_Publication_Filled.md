## Defensive Publication Statement
This document is an **enabling public disclosure** intended to create **prior art** as of its publication date on Zenodo. The authors **do not seek patent protection** on the disclosed subject matter and dedicate this disclosure to the public to prevent future monopolization. *(License: **CC0 1.0**—public‑domain dedication.)*

## Title of Method
**Bamboo Perimeter Wind/Sunbreak and Shelterbelt System Integrated with Hemp (Cannabis sativa) Row Cropping for Yield Stability, Water Savings, and Soil/Carbon Gains**

---

## Abstract (≤120 words)
A reproducible “living perimeter” method using clumping bamboo shelterbelts around hemp fields to moderate wind and sun, reduce lodging and evapotranspiration, and increase yield stability. The system specifies taxa suited to USDA Zone 8a/8b (North Texas), belt geometry, spacing, optional rhizome containment, irrigation, soil program, and MRV protocol. Target outcomes: 20–40% wind‑speed reduction at 5H leeward, 10–20% irrigation savings, 30–60% erosion reduction, and +5–12% hemp yield versus unprotected controls, with co‑products (chips, biochar).

## Background & Prior Art (50–80 words)
Shelterbelts and windbreaks are established agronomic practices. This disclosure enables a **specific configuration** for North Texas hemp: clumping bamboo taxa, double/triple‑row belts sized to deliver ~40–50% porosity, defined offsets to minimize shading, optional containment details when runners are used, and MRV steps to quantify microclimate, soil, and yield impacts. The intent is to prevent later monopolization of substantially similar field designs and kits.

## Enabling Disclosure
Provide specific, reproducible parameters so a skilled agronomist can implement without undue experimentation.

- **Site & Crop Context:** Collin County, TX; USDA Zone 8a/8b; clay‑loam; hemp fiber/cannabinoid cultivars at 1.2–1.6 m in‑row × 1.5–2.0 m between rows.  
- **Bamboo Taxa (clumping preferred):** *Bambusa textilis* ‘Gracilis’ (approx. 6–8 m), *B. multiplex* ‘Alphonse Karr’ (4–6 m). For colder pockets, consider *B. textilis* forms; avoid running *Phyllostachys* unless barriers are installed.  
- **Perimeter Geometry:**  
  - **North & West edges (storm/winter winds):** triple row, belt width **4.5 m**.  
  - **South & East edges (summer sun; lighter winds):** double row, belt width **3.0 m**.  
  - Continuous ring except **12 m** gated breaks at access points. Corner wraps radius **6 m**.  
- **Plant Spacing:** In‑row **1.5 m**; between rows **1.5 m** (staggered). Initial plant size ≥ 2‑gallon.  
- **Containment / Edging:** Clumping taxa require no rhizome barrier; install **30 cm** deep mowing strip/edging to keep crowns tight. If any running bamboo is used, add HDPE barrier **80 mil** × **90 cm** deep, top edge **5 cm** above grade, sloped **10°** outward, seams overlapped **30 cm** and clamped.  
- **Irrigation & Fertigation:** One 16 mm dripline per row; emitters **2 L/hr** at **30 cm** spacing. Yr‑1: 2–3×/week to field capacity; Yr‑2: 1–2×/week; thereafter deficit‑irrigate to establish deep rooting. Fertigate light N in Yr‑1; avoid excess soluble N.  
- **Soil Program:** Per linear meter of belt at planting: compost **8–10 kg**, biochar **3–4 kg** (charged), mycorrhizal inoculant as labeled; mulch **7–10 cm** wood chips. Field‑scale: ~**10 t/ha** compost + **5 t/ha** biochar equivalent in belt footprint.  
- **Establishment Timeline:** Month 0 plant; Month 3 leader selection + side‑shoot pruning; Month 12 first thin; functional porosity by Month **18–24**; peak height by Month **24–36**.  
- **Maintenance SOP:** Winter prune (Jan–Feb), remove dead culms; inspect edging/barriers **2×/yr**; maintain **1 m** mown strip both sides.  
- **Airflow Corridor:** Design belt porosity **40–50%**; target hedge height **6 m** mature. Orientation: reinforce **N** and **W** edges.  
- **Hemp Integration:** Offset crop rows from belt **5 m** (N/W) and **8 m** (S) to minimize summer shading; maintain **4 m** equipment clearance inside perimeter.  
- **Water Management:** Shallow interior swale (0.3 m top width) along belt; connect to bermed low points. Expected crop irrigation reduction **10–20%**.  
- **Co‑Products:** From maintenance thinnings, chips **0.5–1.5 t/yr per 100 m** of belt at maturity; slow‑pyrolysis char yield **25–35%** of dry mass.

## Performance Targets & MRV (Measurement, Reporting & Verification)
- **Microclimate:** Wind speed reduction **20–40%** at 5H leeward; instruments: 2 anemometers (2 m and canopy top) and temp/RH loggers at windward/leeward transects.  
- **Agronomic:** Hemp yield delta **+5–12%**; lodging incidents **−50%** vs. control plots; survival **≥95%**.  
- **Soil/Carbon:** SOC gain **+0.5–1.5 tCO₂e/ha/yr** (field average; 0–30 cm) plus bamboo biomass storage (account separately). Sampling: paired plots, 0–10/10–30 cm, baseline + annual.  
- **Water:** Irrigation water saved **10–20%** vs. control, recorded by inline meters.  
- **Erosion:** Sediment loss **−30–60%** via silt traps and plot‑scale pins after major rain events.

## Variants & Edge Cases
- **Colder winters (≤ Zone 7b):** shift to hardier clumping taxa (consult regional lists) or mixed hedgerows with native evergreens; retain geometry.  
- **High‑salinity soils:** increase composted organics and gypsum; trial *B. textilis* first.  
- **Steep slopes (>5%):** add contour‑aligned shrub layer between bamboo rows; widen belt **+1.5 m**.  
- **Wildfire interface:** maintain **3 m** mineral/mown firebreak outside belt; reduce ladder fuels annually.

## Safety, Compliance, and Biosecurity
Verify county noxious species lists; maintain road sightlines at gates; keep drainage unobstructed; protect wildlife corridors with **≥6 m** ungated spans where practical; comply with right‑of‑way setbacks and neighbor fencing codes.
